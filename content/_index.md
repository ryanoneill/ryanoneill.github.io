I've been working at Apple for a little over a year now on load balancing infrastructure, mostly centered on developing high scale proxies (handling millions of requests per second). 

Prior to Apple, I worked at Twitter for nine years building libraries, frameworks, and product platforms used by thousands of engineers. For the middle five of those, I worked on [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle), Twitter's distributed systems, concurrency, and RPC library. Finagle acted as an inspiration for [Envoy](https://mattklein123.dev/2021/09/14/5-years-envoy-oss/index.html), Rust's [Tokio](https://medium.com/@carllerche/announcing-tokio-df6bb4ddb34) and Meta's [Wangle](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/04/20/networking-traffic/wangle-an-asynchronous-c-networking-and-rpc-library/).
