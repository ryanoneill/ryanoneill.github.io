I've been working at Apple for a little over a year now on load balancing infrastructure, mostly centered on developing high scale proxies (handling millions of requests per second). 

Prior to Apple, I worked at Twitter for nine years building libraries, frameworks, and product platforms used by thousands of engineers. For the middle five of those, I worked on [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle), Twitter's distributed systems, concurrency, and RPC library. Finagle acted as an inspiration for [Envoy](https://mattklein123.dev/2021/09/14/5-years-envoy-oss/index.html), Rust's [Tokio](https://medium.com/@carllerche/announcing-tokio-df6bb4ddb34) and Meta's [Wangle](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/04/20/networking-traffic/wangle-an-asynchronous-c-networking-and-rpc-library/).

My interests can be varied, but fairly straightforward:

* Rigorous engineering challenges that require technical discipline, skilled craftspeople, and continued relentless focus, passion, and investment. I'm a strong believer in the value of consistent 1% improvements that add up over time.

* Designing APIs for customers that deal with complexity in ways that allow those folks to focus on doing their job and not becoming an expert in yours. Essentially this entails making very hard things look simple, especially when they are anything but.

* Dealing with problems of scale, whether it be copious amounts of traffic, efficient utilization of resources, or tons of data.

* A culture of continuous organizational learning.
